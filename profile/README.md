[Me](https://github.com/blackninja511) and [My friend](https://github.com/ycarf) are making a huge Greg project with maybe some easter eggs🌈

The way that YOU🫵 can get involved is by supporting Greg, cause he just is the best💪


If you have any suggestions/ideas or any bugs that you find, let me know ☝🤓
